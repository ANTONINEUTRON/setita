Here’s an outline and algorithm for a Solana contract for Setita’s milestone-based donation system. The goal is to allow fundraisers to create campaigns with milestones, enabling donors to fund projects and track the release of funds as milestones are achieved.  

---

### **High-Level Flow**  

1. **Campaign Creation**:  
   - A fundraiser creates a campaign with predefined milestones, specifying:  
     - Total funding goal.  
     - Milestone descriptions, deadlines, and amounts to be released for each milestone.  
   - Campaign details are stored on-chain.  

2. **Donations**:  
   - Donors contribute funds to the campaign in cryptocurrency.  
   - Contributions are escrowed in the smart contract.  

3. **Milestone Approval**:  
   - Once a milestone is reached, the fundraiser submits a request to release funds for that milestone.  
   - Donors vote to approve or reject the release of funds.  
   - If approved, the contract releases the allocated amount to the fundraiser.  
   - If rejected, donors can vote to recover their remaining contributions.  

4. **Campaign Completion**:  
   - If all milestones are completed successfully, the campaign is marked as successful, and any remaining funds are sent to the fundraiser.  

5. **Refunds**:  
   - Donors can request refunds for their unused contributions if a milestone is missed or rejected.

### **Algorithm**  

#### **Data Structures**  
```solidity
struct Milestone {
    string description;
    uint256 deadline;
    uint256 amount;
    bool approved;
    bool completed;
}

struct Campaign {
    address fundraiser;
    uint256 totalGoal;
    uint256 totalRaised;
    uint256 milestonesCompleted;
    Milestone[] milestones;
    mapping(address => uint256) donorBalances;
    bool isCompleted;
}
```

#### **Key Functions**  

1. **Create Campaign**  
   - Input: `totalGoal`, `milestones` (array of descriptions, deadlines, and amounts).  
   - Logic:  
     - Validate that `sum(milestones.amount) == totalGoal`.  
     - Store campaign details on-chain.  

2. **Donate**  
   - Input: `campaignID`, `amount`.  
   - Logic:  
     - Verify the campaign exists and is not completed.  
     - Transfer funds from the donor to the contract.  
     - Update `campaign.totalRaised` and `donorBalances`.  

3. **Request Milestone Release**  
   - Input: `campaignID`, `milestoneIndex`.  
   - Logic:  
     - Verify the milestone exists and the deadline has passed.  
     - Emit a proposal for donors to vote.  

4. **Vote on Milestone**  
   - Input: `campaignID`, `milestoneIndex`, `vote` (approve/reject).  
   - Logic:  
     - Count votes.  
     - If `approve_votes > reject_votes`, set `milestone.approved = true`.  
     - If rejected, donors can vote to reclaim funds.  

5. **Release Funds**  
   - Input: `campaignID`, `milestoneIndex`.  
   - Logic:  
     - Verify the milestone is approved.  
     - Transfer `milestone.amount` to the fundraiser.  
     - Update campaign status.  

6. **Request Refund**  
   - Input: `campaignID`.  
   - Logic:  
     - Verify milestone rejection or campaign failure.  
     - Refund each donor their remaining contribution.  

7. **Complete Campaign**  
   - Logic:  
     - Mark the campaign as completed once all milestones are approved and funded.

### **Example Workflow**  

1. **Fundraiser Creates a Campaign**:  
   - `totalGoal = 1000 USDC`  
   - Milestones:  
     1. Prototype: `deadline = 30 days`, `amount = 300 USDC`.  
     2. MVP: `deadline = 60 days`, `amount = 400 USDC`.  
     3. Launch: `deadline = 90 days`, `amount = 300 USDC`.  

2. **Donor Contributes 500 USDC**.  
   - Escrow updates:  
     - `campaign.totalRaised = 500`.  
     - `donorBalances[donor1] = 500`.  

3. **Prototype Milestone Deadline Reached**.  
   - Fundraiser requests funds.  
   - Donors vote:  
     - 70% approve -> Funds released to fundraiser.  

4. **MVP Milestone Missed**.  
   - Donors vote to reclaim funds:  
     - 60% approve -> Donor balances refunded.

### **Benefits**  
- **Transparency**: Donors see how funds are used for each milestone.  
- **Accountability**: Fundraisers are incentivized to meet milestones.  
- **Security**: Escrow system ensures funds are only released upon approval.
